## Typescript
I am completely new to using Typescript and the syntax so far does not seem too difficult to understand. It obviously shares some similarities with Java in terms of loops, if statements, and switch cases, which is pretty much up to intuition for me. Having an intuitive nature is one reason why I like typescript. Another reason is how it adds a type system for Javascript, which makes variables much more easier to manage. 

The IDE Typescript Playground is simple to use and navigate which makes it perfect for practice. It has a "plug and play" sort of aspect of the IDE that makes it easier for a beginner like me to practice the language faster. The user interface has no complex configurations to write and run code. The "Share" option, which is very convenient for sharing your code and submitting assignments, is just a click of a button and a link to your is instantly created to be shared for others to review and edit.
 
## Teaching Format
I think I like the style of teaching for this class. Although the WODs do seem stressful, the practice WODs are very helpful with giving us insight on what the actual WODs are. I enjoy doing assignments that are typically trial and error, meaning after trying to complete the assignment I get an immediate answer saying that I got it right or wrong. This then allows me to find out what the problem is immediately after. As well as allowing infinite tries until the due date and free use of any resources including AI such as ChtaGPT to complete the assignments. 

However, this amount of freedom to complete assignments does make me feel as if I need to limit myself to figuring out solutions on my own before using any resources. This is what I like to do on the practice WODs; I test myself to find solutions on the first trial, and then use any resources to help me if I have already spent too much time. After the first trial, I give myself some time in between each trial to try again until I can complete the WOD within the time required. The reason I give myself time between each trial is so I do not just remember what I did on my last attempt, but to also understand why the solution solves the problem.
