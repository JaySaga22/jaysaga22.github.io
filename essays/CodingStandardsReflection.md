## Are coding standards necessary?

In my opinion, coding standards are not a "waste of time". One could argue details like whether you use tabs or spaces may seem minuscule, but these “small” choices are the foundation of maintainable and readable code. More importantly, it develops good habits and they create a common benchmark for teams to work more efficiently.

Without coding standards, every project would feel like starting from scratch because every developer would have their own way of doing things. Standards create that much needed consistency so that everyone is on the same page, whether you're working solo or in a team.

## Coding standards as a learning tool

One of the unexpected benefits I’ve noticed is how coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. It’s not just about following rules; it’s about internalizing best practices that improve your problem solving approach. For example, sticking to TypeScript’s type safety rules has helped me understand the language’s structure better, making my code more robust and less prone to errors.

## First impressions of ESLint with VSCode

My first impressions of ESLint and VSCode is a bit trivial. Configuring ESLint in VSCode has been quite challenging since it does not run in the ways it is intended for. A few examples are: running `npm run lint` in the terminal didn’t always catch all the errors, and, this may not be related to ESLint, but whenever I want to see the output of some typescript code, the javascript version of the typescript code is not created on the first run of the code.

## Is it painful or useful?

Eliminating all the ESLint errors can be somewhat tedious to solve. However, this effort can ultimately prove to be valuable. Whenever you refine your code to adhere to these standards, you are not only completing time consumuing work; you are enhancing its readability, maintainability, and overall professionalism.

In the end, this "frustration" has its benefits. It encourages a more thoughtful approach to writing code, prompting developers to pay attention to the quality of their work. While it can be inconvenient when you are simply trying to get something functional, in the long run, it cultivates better coding habits, which is where its true benefit lies.
