## Overview
The Warrior Recreational Center holds a schedule to prioritize volleyball nets over basketball nets on Tuesdays and Thursday. It usually unknown who is at the gym and when we can make teams and start to play a proper 6 vs. 6 game. A solution I propose is make an app or website that lets people know when those games are starting and who is currently at the gym.

## Approach
A homepage that asks the user to login or sign up. After logging there will be a calender that displays the days of the week. The day that user is logged in on would be highlighted and prompts if it is a volleyball day or not. There will be a navigation bar with tabs that display: the active state of the games, a lists of names of who in the gym, a list of names of who is playing volleyball, a friends list, and a tab for teams with a scoreboard.

## Use Case Ideas
  - User logs in and clicks on the friends list to see if their friend(s) is in the gym
  - User logs in to check when the games are starting
  - User logs in to see if there is a spot open on a team
  - User logs in to look at the score boards.

## Beyond the Basics
Users would be able to link accounts from other apps or websites such as instagram, dicsord, and tiktok. Clicking on a another user's name will display their profile. Their profile would have links to their other account like instagram, discord, and tiktok.
