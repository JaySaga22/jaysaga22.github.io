I am interested about technology, and it interesting to explore the dynamic field of software engineering. My interests in video games, web design, and 3D models open up career paths that combine these areas. I'm hope to develop my skills and gain experiences in these domains.

## Video Game Development
I have always liked video games and wondered how they are made. To pursue this interest, I am interested to learn game engines like Unity, Game Maker Studio, and Godot, along with their associated programming languages (C# and C++). I also want to understand game design principles, level design, and user experience. To gain hands-on experience, I'll create some small games.

## Web Design and Development
Web design appeals to me as it combines creativity with technical skills. I aim to to gain experience in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll also focus on back-end development skills to create full-stack applications. To showcase my abilities, I plan to build a portfolio of personal projects.

## Modeling and Computer Graphics
My interest in 3D models complements both game development and web design. I want to learn 3D modeling software like Blender or Maya and understand computer graphics principles. As I progress, I'll explore advanced topics like real-time rendering and virtual reality development. To gain practical experience, I'll create 3D assets for my game projects and integrate 3D elements into web applications.
