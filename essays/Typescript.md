I am completely new to using Typescript and the syntax so far does not seem too difficult to understand. It obviously does share some similarities with Java in terms of loops, if statements, and switch cases, which is pretty much up to intuition for me. This is one reason why I like typescript. Another reason is how it adds a type system for Javascript, which makes variables much more easier to manage. 

I think I like the style of teaching for this class. Although, the WODs do seem stressful, the practice WODs are very helpful with preparing us.
