## Overview
Creating effort esitmations and tracking them is quite crucial to managing a project. This short essay follows how my team members and I tracked our efforts and made esitmations for this project.

## How We Made Our Effort Estimates
Effort estimates were primarily based on experience with the task. Each of us used our software development experience to find how to about an issue. We had estimates that also included learning curves. An example is when I had a task involving unfamiliar areas, such as fixing the schema (Issue #24), I included extra time for experimentation and checking for errors.

## Benefits of Effort Estimates
Thanks to this course, it provided what was needed for us to complete this project, such as providing the structure of web development. That structure being the nextjs application and the WODs to help us build experience and understanding of subject.

## Was Tracking Actual Effort Beneficial?
Yes, tracking effort was beneficial since it helped improve our planning. It also gave a sense of where each member is most and least proficient in a topic.

## How We Tracked Actual Effort
Tracking our effort was done by using discord. Each of us had our own channels on our server to record our time. How I tracked my time was using a stopwatch on either my phone or in a tab on my browser.

## Accuracy of Effort Tracking
The accuracy for tracking our effort was not the most precise. However, estimations in terms of 5 - 10 minute intervals do not drastically compromise our tracking.

## Conclusion
Tracking our efforts and making estimations are quite beneficial to our project management. Doing this process has educated me on how a project in a professional setting could operate; coordinating with a team, communicating and working with eachother on multiple topics within the project.
