# VBall Recorder
Proposer: Jayden Sagayaga

## Overview
The Warrior Recreational Center holds a schedule to prioritize volleyball nets over basketball nets on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Currently, there’s no convenient way to know who is at the gym or when a proper 6 vs. 6 game can start. A solution I propose is to make an app or website that lets people know when those games are starting and who is currently at the gym.

## Approach
The homepage will prompt the user to log in or sign up. After logging in, users will see a calendar displaying the days of the week, with the current day highlighted and an indicator if it’s a volleyball day. There will be a navigation bar with tabs that display: the active state of the games, a lists of names of who in the gym, a list of names of who is playing volleyball, a friends list, and a tab for teams with a scoreboard.

## Use Case Ideas
  - User logs in and clicks on the friends list to see if their friend(s) is in the gym
  - User logs in to check when the games are starting
  - User logs in to see if there is a spot open on a team
  - User logs in to look at the score boards.

## Beyond the Basics
Users would be able to link accounts from other apps or websites such as instagram, dicsord, and tiktok. Clicking on a another user's name will display their profile. Their profile would have links to their other account like instagram, discord, and tiktok.
